# W1D3a - CSS Practice
I went throught all the practice exercises.
### Difficulties and learned things
- Honestly, I spent about 30 minutes for each sub exercise but I didn't find out the fit solution with the expectation (there are some small differences).
- I confused about using float & clear before doing these exercises. However, after doing these exercises, I really understand them.
- In the exercise More Floats - appearances 2 - the third requirement (number 4), I worked around with a fixed value for the "margin-left" and "margin-right", but it's worked as the requirement. E.g.
```
margin-left: 20px;
margin-right: 20px;
```
- One more thing, I stuck in the exercise More Floats - appearances 2 - the third requirement (number 6), I didn't think about using the absolute position for the #b div.
